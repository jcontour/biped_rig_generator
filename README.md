## Create your model
Create a symmetrical biped character model

The locators should be moved to joint positions according to their name. 

You only need to position locators for one arm and one leg.

COG means "center of gravity", place at the middle of the pelvis. 

## Step 2: 
After locators are placed, generate the rig. 

Rig features:

IK legs

IK/FK switch arms, choose which mode you prefer using the control at the hands. 

## Step 3: 
The rig is ready to have the mesh bound to it, click the "select joints" button to select all joints that should be used in skinning. 

You get to paint skin weights!

Have fun!
